# React-Notes
## About this app
This is a simple web app made with react that allows you to store notes. A demo can be found [here](https://react-notes.neocities.org).

## What I've learned
With this project I've learned to
* Use a git in a real project with multiple branches
* Implement animations in React
* Create and deploy a development version of React
* Adding external CSS and JS to React

## TODO
* Create some kind of front-end persistence; my first thought was using cookies but now I'm aiming towards local storage.
